# Contributing

So, you want to help improve this extension? That is fantastic, you are a _wonderful_ person, thank you! Given that I this is a
spare-time project, and I'm fully employed, I can use all the help I can get.

## Bugs and Feature Requests
1. Report bugs in the [Issues](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/issues) section. Please explain your bugs as best you can. Bugs 
   without a reproduction might not be fixable. 
2. Ask for features in the [Issues](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/issues) section too. Keep in mind that while I personally 
   cannot add everything - I have to constrain
   my own workload around features I myself will have a use for - perhaps there's another kind person who will be able to add it?

## Pull Requests
Since I cannot possibly do everything myself, I will certainly accept pull requests - but I must ask that you follow a few ground 
rules. This is so I can keep control of the repository, and to help prevent you wasting your time on work that I will reject.

1. **Remember that many users will be inexperienced both with IDEs and coding**. It's very important that your feature is easy
   to use.
2. Please _ask me_ before starting work on a larger contribution. I have the final say in what I want added. Remember, this is 
   still a project I actually made for my _own_ use. I can tell you if what you want to add will be rejected outright and I really 
   don't want you to waste your time, it's too valuable for me. You can either ask via an [Issue](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/issues) or you can try reaching me at [Keen's official Discord](https://discord.gg/0hIE7GirODUqhfIg).
3. I recommend not trying to do a pull request unless you already have a bit of experience in coding. Visual Studio is not a forgiving
   application to extend. This isn't any kind of requirement though, if your addition isn't too large you might get some help finishing.
4. Remember that I will have to review your work. Anything you can do to help that process will be appreciated.
5. Expect criticism.
6. Use common sense.
