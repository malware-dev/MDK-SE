**WARNING** Still prerelease and buggy. Not ready for general use yet!

A toolkit to help with ingame script (programmable block) development for Keen Software House's space sandbox Space Engineers. It helps you create a ready-to-code project for writing ingame scripts, and provides an analyzer which warns you if you're trying to use something that is not allowed in Space Engineers. It also provides a code minifier to make your deployed script as small as possible - albeit somewhat unreadable.

Space Engineers is trademarked to Keen Software House. This toolkit is fan-made, and its developer has no relation to Keen Software House.
